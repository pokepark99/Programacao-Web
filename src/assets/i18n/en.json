    "FIELD_DESC": "The Field Museum in Chicago has its roots in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Initially known as the Columbian Museum of Chicago, it was renamed the Field Museum of Natural History in 1905 in honor of its primary benefactor, Marshall Field. Over the years, it has expanded its collections and research, focusing on anthropology, botany, geology, and zoology. Notable expeditions, such as the Field Museum-East Greenland Expedition of 1932-1933, have enriched its collection. Today, the museum is a global leader in scientific research, education, and conservation, promoting an understanding of the natural world and cultural diversity."
