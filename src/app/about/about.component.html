            <p>We are a platform dedicated to bringing together the galleries of the world's best museums in one place.
                This project was developed as part of the Web Programming course for 2023/2024, with the mission to make
                museum visits more interactive and engaging.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to provide users with an innovative and fun way to explore museums. We believe that art
                and culture should be accessible to everyone, and that gamification can make learning and discovery even
                more rewarding.</p>

            <h2>What Makes Us Unique?</h2>
            <p><strong>Gamification:</strong> On our site, you don't just visit museums; you also earn badges and
                achievements as you explore. Each time you visit a museum, it is recorded in your profile. The more
                museums you visit, the more rewards you earn!</p>
            <p><strong>Personalized Profile:</strong> In your profile, you can see all the museums you've visited
                recently and track your progress. Our achievements system encourages you to keep exploring and
                discovering new exhibitions.</p>
